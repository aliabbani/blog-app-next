This repository contains a full-stack blog app built with Next.js, Prisma, and MongoDB. It is a simple but complete example of how to use these technologies to build a modern web application.

The app features the following functionality:

- Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- Users can comment on blog posts.
- Users can subscribe to blog posts.
- Users can authenticate with GitHub.

The app is built using the following technologies:

- Next.js: A React framework that allows for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- Prisma: An ORM that makes it easy to interact with a database from a Node.js application.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing blog posts and comments.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog-app.git
cd blog-app

npm install
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
